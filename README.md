# Global Tech Inc. – Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design

This project is a completed network infrastructure design for Global Tech Inc., a medium-sized organization with two main sites based in Johannesburg. The network was built using Cisco Packet Tracer and addresses the need for scalability, redundancy, and secure inter-site and inter-departmental communication.

## Scenario Overview

- Two main sites: Site A and Site B
- Departments:
  - Site A: Finance, Marketing, Engineering
  - Site B: Finance, Marketing, Server Room
- Base network: 192.168.100.0/24 (subnetted per VLAN)
- Routing Protocol: RIPv2
- VLANs: Assigned per department
- Wireless networks implemented for each department

## Objectives Achieved

- Logical Network Design: Structured and scalable topology using Cisco best practices
- Redundancy: Dual routers, multilayer switches, and ISPs to ensure network availability
- Wireless Integration: Department-based wireless networks for user mobility
- Dynamic Routing: Configured RIPv2 for automatic route distribution between sites
- Security: SSH access, port security, and ACLs implemented on critical devices
- Servers: Centralized DHCP and DNS servers for efficient network service management
- Inter-VLAN Routing: Enabled via multilayer switches for inter-department communication
- Testing and Verification: All configurations tested for end-to-end connectivity and performance
